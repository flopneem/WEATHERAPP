12/27/23 coding excersise
Titled: Weather App
went through a walkthrough to build a weather app

one thing to learn and focus on is the css styling of things if I had a complete
understanding of how to align things, pixel sizes, font sizes. Front end programming
will become easier.

touched on a bit of html today, classes are extremely important. It allows you 
to assign images to the declared class, even within a class you can declare another
class for you to store more things.

images can be attributed to a class within a single line.
CSS is a rudementary programming language, it focuses more on developing the look
of things. I wouldn't say it excludes functionality but from what i can tell the
language isn't as math heavy as java or python.

divs are used to call classes.

make sure to research scripts in CSS

in order to use an api within the css code, an api key needs to be generated a url
should be given to use as a tool to access the api

its a good idea to put the function name at the end of the statement to call the
function when the code runs.

I had some trouble figuring out this bit of code right here
const searchBox = document.querySelector(".search input");
const searchBtn = document.querySelector(".search button")
document refers to the html documentation, querySelector calls a method and 
.search input and search button are the css selectors I had made.


another bit of code when disected
 searchBtn.addEventListener("click", ()=>{
        checkWeather(searchBox.value);
adding an eventListener to searchBtn, so when the user "clicks" the program will know
the click will trigger the program to call the value of searchBox. 
Having the checkWeather function in the program will be used to call the entire
function since we removed the singular checkWeather();

added another eventListner to the code so if a user presses the enter key when 
inputing the city name it would still execute
searchBox.addEventListener("keydown", (event) => {
    // Check if the pressed key is Enter (key code 13)
    if (event.keyCode === 13) {
        checkWeather(searchBox.value);
        }
    });
